### Using Docker
Thanks to [satcom886](https://github.com/satcom886) GLOB has a Dockerfile and so can be served in Docker  

Images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/satcom886/glob). The table below explains the tags.

|  Tag   |   Update   |                                 Description                                                 |
|:------:|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| latest |   on push  | Built automatically using a GitHub Action                                                   |
| stable | irregularly | Built by [satcom886](https://github.com/satcom886) whenever a version is mostly working    |

#### Configuration

 * The `DISCORD_TOKEN` variable **needs to be set**. You can get your token from [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
 * (optional) Choose a place to store GLOB's database using a mount point. If you don't set a mount point for GLOB's data, GLOB won't remember your settings and data.
 * (optional) Set the `REDDIT_*` variables for using GLOB's Reddit functionality.

##### Pure Docker

```
docker run \
 -e DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_token" \
 -e REDDIT_USERNAME="meeeeee" \
 -e REDDIT_ID="smt" \
 -e REDDIT_PASSWORD="VerySecret" \
 -e REDDIT_SECRET="MoreSecret" \
 -e REDDIT_USERAGENT="NetScape-Navigator" \
 --mount type=bind,source=/your/datadir,target=/GLOB/data \
 satcom886/glob
```

##### Using `docker-compose`

```yaml
version: "3.5"
services:
  glob:
    image: satcom886/glob
    ## Uncomment to auto-start
